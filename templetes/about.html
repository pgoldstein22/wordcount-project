<h1> About this project </h1>
<a href ="{% url 'home' %}"> Home Page </a>

<h2> I did this project to get a basic understanding of django</h2>

<h3> In this project, you can enter a text and it will return the count of words
  in the text in descending order.
</h3>

<h4>
  We created url paths in the urls.py, and functions that use the HttpResponse argument
  to return render, linking the page to the url and other results. Such as <br/>
  <h5>
    count - which displayed the number of total words found in the text.<br/><br/>

    SortedWords - which requested the "full text" which the user entered
    in the homepage. We created a dictionary. <br/><br/>
    The data was then parsed and added to a dictionary with the form {"word" : count}
    if the word was already found in the dictionary, we increased the count
    to reflect the count of word.<br/>

    fulltext - which is not displayed in the "count.html" page, but does allow us to displayed
    the full text the user entered if we desired.<br/>
  </h5>
  Please note, the actual count of words my be slighty skewed.
  <h5>
    This is due to the fact that we did not remove special characters, as the purpose of This
    website is to merely begin to learn Django and develop a functioning website <br/>
    A more precise count will be implemented in a future version as it is
    basic python coding.
